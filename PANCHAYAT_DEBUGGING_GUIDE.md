# Panchayat Creation Debugging Guide

## Issue Description
You're experiencing issues while creating panchayats. This guide will help you identify and fix the problem.

## Debugging Steps

### 1. Check Browser Console
Open your browser's developer tools (F12) and check the console for error messages when trying to create a panchayat.

### 2. Test API Connection
Click the "Test API" button to verify:
- API endpoint is accessible
- Authentication token is valid
- Server is responding

### 3. Test Panchayat Creation
Click the "Test Create" button to test creation with sample data:
- Uses hardcoded sample data
- Bypasses form validation
- Shows detailed API response

### 4. Form Validation Check
When submitting the form, check console for:
- Form data structure
- Data types
- Validation errors

### 5. Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue 1: Authentication Token Missing
**Symptoms:**
- 401 Unauthorized errors
- "Token Missing" in console logs

**Solution:**
- Log out and log back in
- Check if token is stored in localStorage
- Verify token hasn't expired

#### Issue 2: Invalid Data Types
**Symptoms:**
- 422 Validation errors
- Server expects integers but receives strings

**Solution:**
- The code now converts IDs to integers
- Check console for data type logs

#### Issue 3: Missing Required Fields
**Symptoms:**
- Form submission blocked
- Validation error messages

**Solution:**
- Ensure all required fields are filled
- Check that Lok Sabha, Vidhan Sabha, and Block are selected
- Verify panchayat name is not empty

#### Issue 4: API Endpoint Issues
**Symptoms:**
- 404 Not Found errors
- 500 Server errors

**Solution:**
- Verify API endpoint `/api/panchayats` exists
- Check server logs for backend errors
- Ensure Laravel backend is running

#### Issue 5: CORS Issues
**Symptoms:**
- CORS errors in console
- Network request blocked

**Solution:**
- Check if backend has CORS configured
- Verify API base URL is correct
- Check if using correct protocol (http/https)

### 6. Debugging Information Added

The following debugging features have been added:

#### Enhanced Console Logging
- Form submission details
- API call information
- Response data and errors
- Data type validation

#### Test Functions
